## Overview

This project presents a network of cooperative exploration rovers designed for planetary research and life support in extraterrestrial environments. Each rover functions autonomously while maintaining coordination with others, forming a scalable and resilient exploration system. Built with replicable and low-cost components, the design emphasizes accessibility, automation, and real-world applicability for both educational and research purposes.

Key innovations include:

1. **Swarm and Automation System**:
   - The rovers operate collectively using swarm robotics principles, autonomously navigating terrain and optimizing task distribution without constant human supervision.

2. **Multi-Hop Communication Mesh**:
   - A mesh-based communication network allows each rover to act as a repeater, ensuring stable data transmission and command relay across uneven or extended terrain.

3. **Signal Amplification**:
   - The mesh system extends communication range and operational distance, improving energy efficiency and mission reliability compared to traditional single-link designs.

4. **Simulation and Accessibility**:
   - Using affordable hardware such as ESP32, L298N, and standard DC motors, the system can be easily replicated for educational or research purposes.

5. **Mini Laboratories**:
   - Each unit includes onboard sensors and cameras to collect environmental data (temperature, pressure, imagery), enabling mapping, documentation, and support for future extraterrestrial missions.

This initiative demonstrates how collaborative, low-cost robotics can contribute to the advancement of autonomous systems and sustainable exploration beyond Earth.
